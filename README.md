# Chat-App
Real-Time Communication Powered by Socket.io, React, and Node.js
Built with Node.js as the backend server, our Chat App harnesses the power of Socket.io to enable instant messaging, keeping conversations flowing in real-time.
Socket.io's event-driven architecture ensures that messages are delivered promptly to recipients.

The Chat-App enables communication between two or more persons at the same time.
A person can send their messages using the Rich Text Provider. The Rich Text Provider provides a wide range of text formating options like Link Insertion, Image Insertion, Code snippet etc.

To start the project - 
  1. Start the backend server
     
     -> Navigate to the backend folder - `cd backend`
     
     -> Install dependencies using NodeJS - `npm install`

     -> Start the server using `npm start`

  2. Start the frontend
